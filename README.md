# The way this game is right now

The dominos so far isn't completed fully yet. There still needs things to be added to the game to make it so much better. The game will eventually be complete and fully functional.

# The steps to make this game work as it stands

The dominos are assets that are uploaded from a zip file to unity to be used for the game. Then the dominos are placed where you want them to be and add a rigidbody and box collider to them. That is done by clicking on the domino itself and click the add component button at the bottom of the inspector window. These are the steps to make it have the physics needed to fall over and do what it needs to do.
